## Run an experiment 

```shell
python3 main.py --config=CDS_QPLEX --env-config=academy_3_vs_1_with_keeper 
```

The config files act as defaults for an algorithm or environment. 

They are all located in `config`.
`--config` refers to the config files in `config/algs`
`--env-config` refers to the config files in `config/envs`

## Data

GRF data is located in 'data', where we show the performance of CDS with QPLEX or QMIX.
