# CDS: Celebrating Diversity in Shared Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

The paper is now available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02195.pdf) and accepted by NeurIPS 2021. Our approach can help both value-based and policy-based baselines (such as QMIX, QPLEX, and MAPPO) to explore sophisticated strategies for improving learning efficiency in challenging benchmarks.
